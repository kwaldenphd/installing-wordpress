# WordPress installation lab

In this lab, we will install WordPress on our Raspberry Pi Webserver. 

WordPress has two versions: 
1. a hosted version Wordpress.com where you create a login and have web access to the administrative end of the software so that you can create and modify a website
2. a self-hosted version from Wordpress.org that you install on your server and manage the WordPress instance locally yourself. The self-hosted version allows you to make many more customizations to your site and the software and have full control of the site. 

With the hosted version, you are accessing the software on another server maintained by the developer of the software. With the self-hosted version, you are installing and accessing the software on your own server – in this case, our Raspberry Pi. The other option is to use a third-party host like https://reclaimhosting.com/. With this option a third-party maintains the server (the computer), but you have full access at the Terminal just like you do on your Pi. You can download any software that you’d like and work with the system at the command line. You are essentially leasing space on another's server.

## Lab Objectives

By the end of this lab you will be able to:
-	Explain the differences between hosted and self-hosted software
-	Describe how the elements of the LAMP stack work together with self-hosted software
-	Install and configure an FTP client on your Pi
-	Build a website using WordPress

Let’s take a look at WordPress. The full WordPress documentation can be found at https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page. 

You should start with “Installing WordPress” https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress. First, take a look at “Things to Know Before Installing WordPress.”
